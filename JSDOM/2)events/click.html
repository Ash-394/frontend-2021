<!--EVENT HANDLING -->

<!--Events are actions that take place in the browser that can either be started by the user or the browser itself. 
    A user clicking a button, submitting a form, or pressing a key on their keyboard are all examples of events in action-->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <!-- EVENT: CLICK-->

<!--Now that we have rendered our buttons on screen, we would them to do some work when they are clicked. Buttons in websites
lets you do various things. For eg: Send buttons send a message, back button takes to the previous page. 
However, all of this happens only when you click them. So how does the webpage know when the button is clicked or what to do when its clicked? 
-->

<!--Clicking is an event and we have listeners which listen to the events and fire appropriate functions when an event takes place-->
<!--When we click a button, the onclick event fires the function specified-->

<!--In the below code, we will produce an alert when a button is clicked-->
