    <h1>Sample Program to demonstrate external scripting with javascript</h1>

    <!-- You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
    The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.        
    Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because 
    script interpretation slows down the display. -->

    <script src="myScript.js"></script>

    <!-- Note that for this implementation to take effect the script file should be in the 
        same directory as of the HTML file. Otherwise the path should be changed accordingly -->
</body>
